# Dashboard Cleanup Plan

## Objective

To remaster the style in the dashboard, focusing on a cleaner look, especially in the "Generate Mealplan" section, while maintaining the website's basic design.

## Detailed Plan

1.  **Simplify the layout:**
    *   Remove the border around the "Generate Meal Plan" section.
    *   Reduce the padding within the section.
    *   Use a more consistent spacing between elements.
2.  **Improve the styling of the radio buttons and select element:**
    *   Use a more modern and visually appealing style for the radio buttons. Replace the default radio buttons with custom styled elements.
    *   Style the select element to match the overall design. Use a custom styled select element with a dropdown arrow.
    *   Ensure the labels for the radio buttons and select element are clear and easy to read.
3.  **Use a cleaner font and color palette:**
    *   Use the existing CSS variables for theming to ensure consistency with the overall website design.
    *   Use a lighter background color for the section.
    *   Use a darker text color for the labels and values.
4.  **Add more spacing and padding to improve readability:**
    *   Add more spacing between the radio buttons and select element.
    *   Add more padding to the input fields.
5.  **Use subtle visual cues to highlight important elements:**
    *   Use a subtle background color for the selected radio button.
    *   Use a subtle border color for the select element when focused.
6.  **Create a more visually appealing and engaging design:**
    *   Use a more modern and minimalist design.
    *   Use subtle animations to improve the user experience.
